#this is just me trying to recreate a Zork I type text-based adventure game in python

#Possible mechanics:
#inventory button that displays what you have picked up
#places visited viewer
#toggleable assistance/tutorial

#1 - write a basic throughline for the player to follow
#2 - establish basic game window/GUI
#3 - describe end goal and how to achieve it
#4 - make game mechanics to keep the player entertained cause monkey brain (score system?)

and the player is a mercenary sent to slay Snort and return the magical child to his family.
