# Portfolio-2025
In March 2025, I created this portfolio to serve as something to share with future employers and colleagues so that they may see exactly what I have experience in.

Folders will be organized by years since the start date of the portfolio (March 2025), and by relevant metrics such as language, purpose, and importance. 
It is not unlikely that in the future I will be using the repository in collaboration with social media.
Thanks.
